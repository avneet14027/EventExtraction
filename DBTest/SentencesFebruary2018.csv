20-02-2018,"(B)	Editorial  ",“Which ways” – (Urdu Daily –Uqab)
20-02-2018,"Addressing a gathering in Kund Devsar Kulgam while laying foundation stones of different projects, Mehbooba Mufti, Chief Minister reiterated that violence has not solved any issue rather has given birth to many more. While addressing the people of South Kashmir, she said that people should educate their children to shun the path of violence because nothing would be achieved by gun. It only fills our graveyards, widowed our women, children became orphans and parents lost their young ones. She said that give me peace I will advocate for a dialogue process. There is truthfulness in her words. The incidents occurred in the world during the twentieth century taught humans that violence was not a solution of any issue, it would effect the society badly. Everyone is opposing violence in the world and international powers are against it. Militancy was started in Kashmir 30 years ago and a lot of blood was flown on this land. If we examine this, we came to know that except depression we get nothing from it. Chief Minister cannot refute this matter that there was some reason for starting militancy in the State. Neither the politicians have taken this issue seriously nor any serious action has been taken so far. Today the situation is worst than bad. Today no one is paying heed towards this grave problem of people. Democracy is only for namesake. There is no contact of democratic people with common people and they are not aware about the problems being faced by common people. All government departments have been converted into corrupt department. Incapable youth are going ahead in place of capable youth due to corruption. Government sponsored welfare schemes are being given to the undesired persons. As a result people especially educated youths became unemployed. To express their anger, they have chosen the path of violence. Central Government has not taken any concrete step to resolve the issues. When Government has not taken any steps to curb the corruption, how we can hope that youth will play a role in developing the state by leaving violence. For this, the ways needs to be cleaned.
