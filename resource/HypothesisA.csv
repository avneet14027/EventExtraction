An astronomer observes that a planet rotates faster after a meteorite impact. Planetary density will decrease is the most likely effect of this increase in rotation.
A group of engineers wanted to know how different building designs would respond during an earthquake. They made several models of buildings and tested each for its ability to withstand earthquake conditions. Buildings will be built faster will most likely result from testing different building designs.
The end result in the process of photosynthesis is the production of sugar and oxygen. Chemical energy is absorbed through the roots step signals the beginning of photosynthesis.

An astronaut drops a 1.0 kg object and a 5.0 kg object on the Moon. Both objects fall a total distance of 2.0 m vertically. Which of the following best describes the objects after they have fallen a distance of 1.0 m?
"Devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is a disease that is decimating the population of Tasmanian devils. The disease passes from one animal to another through bites and is caused by parasites. The parasites cause cancerous tumors that spread throughout an infected animal's body and kill it. A non-infectious, cell-cycle disease is the best description of DFTD."
"A type of small mammal from the mountain regions of the western United States makes its home out of piles of rock. During summer months, the mammal places grasses and seeds in protected places in the rock piles. To repare for migration before winter is the most likely reason for this behavior."
Petrified palm trees are found in sedimentary rock near glaciers. The presence of the petrified palm trees most likely provides evidence for there was once more water in the area statement.
Farmers in Wyoming were concerned because some of their chickens were being preyed upon by hawks that lived in areas around their ranches. The farmers grouped together and hunted the hawks until they were no longer in their area. The chicken population would go down would most likely happen next.
