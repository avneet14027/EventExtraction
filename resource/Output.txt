Option D: an infectious, chronic disease
Hypothesis Devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is a disease that is decimating the population of Tasmanian devils. The disease passes from one animal to another through bites and is caused by parasites. The parasites cause cancerous tumors that spread throughout an infected animal's body and kill it. An infectious, chronic disease is the best description of DFTD.
