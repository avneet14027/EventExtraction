20-02-2018,(B)	Editorial  ,“Which ways” – (Urdu Daily –Uqab)
20-02-2018,"Addressing a gathering in Kund Devsar Kulgam while laying foundation stones of different projects, Mehbooba Mufti, Chief Minister reiterated that violence has not solved any issue rather has given birth to many more. While addressing the people of South Kashmir, she said that people should educate their children to shun the path of violence because nothing would be achieved by gun. It only fills our graveyards, widowed our women, children became orphans and parents lost their young ones. She said that give me peace I will advocate for a dialogue process. There is truthfulness in her words. The incidents occurred in the world during the twentieth century taught humans that violence was not a solution of any issue, it would effect the society badly. Everyone is opposing violence in the world and international powers are against it. Militancy was started in Kashmir 30 years ago and a lot of blood was flown on this land. If we examine this, we came to know that except depression we get nothing from it. Chief Minister cannot refute this matter that there was some reason for starting militancy in the State. Neither the politicians have taken this issue seriously nor any serious action has been taken so far. Today the situation is worst than bad. Today no one is paying heed towards this grave problem of people. Democracy is only for namesake. There is no contact of democratic people with common people and they are not aware about the problems being faced by common people. All government departments have been converted into corrupt department. Incapable youth are going ahead in place of capable youth due to corruption. Government sponsored welfare schemes are being given to the undesired persons. As a result people especially educated youths became unemployed. To express their anger, they have chosen the path of violence. Central Government has not taken any concrete step to resolve the issues. When Government has not taken any steps to curb the corruption, how we can hope that youth will play a role in developing the state by leaving violence. For this, the ways needs to be cleaned.

23-02-2018,(B)	Editorial,“Rohingya Muslims …… Efforts to make political    debate”
23-02-2018,"Efforts being made by right-wing parties to promote their politics by targeting Rohingya Muslims, who have taken shelter in India after facing oppression in Myanmar, are against all international agreements and principles signed by all member states of the UN, including India.  As in other States of India, 1219 Rohingya families consisting 5743 refugees are putting up in slums in J&K State. The right-wing parties in Jammu have opened a communal front against them.  Now, a constituent of ruling alliance, BJP has also joined this inhuman and immoral politics.  In Recent Assembly session, the Speaker also spoke against these refugees by levelling different allegations against them. Rohingya Muslims are being targeted for any happening in Jammu. Attempt was also made to hold them responsible for recent militant attack on the Army camp in Sujwan, Jammu.  Instead of looking at them with doubtful eyes, they should be treated humanely.  Besides international community, Indian leadership should also make efforts for establishing peace in Rakhiyan so that they could return to their homes with dignity.  Rohingya Muslims are not here illegally.  They are putting up here according to UN Institution for Registration of Refugees.  A petition in the Supreme Court was also under trial at present.  Therefore, there was no justification for doing politics over it.  ",(C)	 Article

24-02-2018,"During her tours in Kashmir, Chief Minister, Mehbooba Mufti has been repeatedly saying that there is no option other than dialogue.  This is the only way to stop bloodshed.  While addressing a public meeting recently in a district of the Valley, she repeatedly asked people to stop their children from stone pelting on forces and to keep them away from militant actions.  At present, Kashmir is a serious issue on the earth. UN has already failed to resolve this issue.  All efforts of America have also proved ineffective; but they have not called the issue as a ‘closed chapter’; instead they lay stress on talks for its resolution.  So far as Government of India is concerned, it has not reached at any conclusion.  At times, it says the issue would be resolved through talks, for which militancy has to be eliminated first.  Pakistan holds India responsible for disturbed situation.  According to Pakistan, India has been provoking Pakistani Army on borders to divert world attention from human rights violations taking place in Kashmir.  Amid voices of dialogue, guns roar on borders and Army camps are being attacked.  Tension between the two countries still continues.  So, it is evident, when fronts are warm and tones are sharp, who could be ready for dialogue and who has time to wait for favourable atmosphere. In this situation, the voice of Mehbooba Mufti for dialogue needs attention. ",(C)	 Article
