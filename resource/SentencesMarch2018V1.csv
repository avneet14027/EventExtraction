10-03-2018,(B) Editorial ,“Misplaced interference of BJP” – (Urdu Daily – Srinagar Times)
10-03-2018,"While rejecting the demand to hand over case of abduction and murder of Kathua girl, Asifa to CBI, Chief Minister, Mehbooba Mufti has said that investigation by Crime Branch of J&K Police has reached last stage and charge sheet would be submitted in the Court within few days.  Two Ministers of BJP, Bali Bhagat and Ajay Nanda revealed this in a new conference after holding a meeting with the Chief Minister.  It is being said that that the two BJP Ministers had met the Chief Minister only to lay stress for handing over the case to CBI. It is astonishing that BJP wants to hand over the case to CBI, which means they openly doubt and have no confidence on their own Police.  If they really don’t trust the Crime Branch of State Police, why don’t they quit the Government?  Should numberless cases with State Crime Branch be also handed over to CBI?  Why don’t they say clearly that there is no need of Crime Branch in J&K Police department and all case files should be handed over to CBI? The question is how BJP could gather courage to raise finger on own Police and why central leadership is silent on this.  It is really a misplaced interference of BJP and Mehbooba Mufti will have to submit the case of Asifa in the court sooner or later. ",(C)Article
